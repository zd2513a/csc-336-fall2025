        <h1>What is FPS Game</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p><strong>First-person shooters</strong> are a type of shooter game that relies on a first-person point of view with which the player experiences the action through the eyes of the character. They differ from third-person shooters in that, in a third-person shooter, the player can see the character they are controlling (usually from behind, or above). The primary design focus is combat, mainly involving firearms or other types of long range weapons.</p>

        <h2>Example:</h2>

        <h2>Origin</h2>

        <p>
            The First-Person Shooter (FPS) genre originated in the 1970s with experimental games like Maze War and Spasim, which introduced the concept of navigating a 3D environment and shooting from a first-person perspective. However, it wasn’t until the early 1990s that FPS became mainstream, largely thanks to id Software’s Wolfenstein 3D (1992), which set the template for the genre, and Doom (1993), which revolutionized it with improved graphics, fast-paced action, and multiplayer gameplay. These innovations paved the way for later classics such as Quake, and ultimately shaped modern shooters like CS:GO, Call of Duty, and Valorant.
